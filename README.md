This is rougelike, couch multiplayer game with procedural generated maps. Point of the game is to get more emeralds than other players.
Game starts with trap arrangment. When one player arranges his traps others players should look away from screen to not get the intel where traps are.
After every player lies down their traps the right game starts. Game is turn-based and every players moves tile per turn.
The point of game is to outsmart your opponents. How? Except for normal traps you have also fake traps that's looks like normal trap but didn't do anything.
Best way to win is mislead others players that fake traps are real and real traps are fake.
